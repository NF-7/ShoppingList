# ShoppingList

First Project in JS after just starting with learning javascript and WebDev.

The idea of the project was to create a shopping list with editable values and buttons and start with learning DOM manipulation, how to call HTML elements and manipulate them using javascript.

In the .js file, there are separators in order to easily look over the code and what every instance of it does.

Included are the functions that Clear and Filter items; retrieve, save, remove and clear items from Local Storage.

There are no limits to how many items could be added or how many can be edited or removed.

The project was instructed as very basic DOM manipulation exercise.

Code is reusable by anyone. Open to additional suggestions regarding code usage/better coding with DRY principle in mind.
